        <h1>About Talent Scout</h1>
        <p>There are many various kinds of social gathering; it could be a birthday or an event in the community or a concert. The success of any social gathering can be determined by the number of people that actually enjoyed the event; this includes the performance of the individual showcasing one’s talent resulting in adding the latter’s and event manager’s portfolio. Everything seems smooth however one of the common problems for hosting/managing an event is finding talents or icebreakers to entertain the crowds; this could take days or weeks for contacting and verifying the talents which is inconvenient. Talent Scout is the One-Stop web application available for finding events which one can showcase his/her talents and could rise to Stardom or are you finding someone perfect for your event; instead of asking someone if they know someone that can sing or dance, etc. One can find it in Talent Scout. </p>
