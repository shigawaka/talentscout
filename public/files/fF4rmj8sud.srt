Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

214
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,962
This company's
founder and my mentor,

215
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,664
Dr. Hank Pym.

216
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,515
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

217
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,784
I immediately started
researching a particle

218
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,653
that could change
the distance between atoms,

219
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,990
while increasing
density and strength.

220
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,926
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

221
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,162
beneath
the dust and cobwebs of

222
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,498
Hank's research,
I couldn't tell you.

223
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,500
But just imagine,

224

Right, Hank?

230
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,732
Silly, I know.

231
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,667

scare the USSR.

234
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,843
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

235
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,147
every single time I asked you,

236
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:55,517
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

237
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,219
Just a tall tale.

238
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,087
Right.

239
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,457
Because how could anything
so miraculous
possibly be real?

240
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,737
Well,
I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

241
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,640
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

242
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:21,510
I thought,
could it be possible
to shrink a person?

243
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,013
Could that be done?

244
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:28,818
Well,
it's not a legend anymore.

00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,431
How am I supposed to do this?

709
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:06,707
All right,
just one step at a time.

710
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:09,643
Ugh!

711
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:15,816
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

712
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:21,221
HOPE:
I could take down the servers

713
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:22,356
and Cross
wouldn't even know it.

714
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,857
We don't need this guy.

715
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,193
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

716
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,662
I did. She's great.

717
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,165
She doesn't think
that we need you.

718
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,633
We don't.
We can do this ourselves.

719
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,702
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

720
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,572
and then Hope
has you arrested.

721
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,475
Okay, we can try
this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

722
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,644
She's a little bit anxious.

723
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,546
It has to do with this job,

724
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:47,748
which, judging by the fact
that you're
sitting opposite me,

725
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,317
I take it that
you're interested in.

726
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,485
What job?

727
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,453
Would you like some tea?

728
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,788
Uh... Sure.

729
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:56,657
I was very impressed with

730
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,260
how you managed to get
past my security system.

731
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,564
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

732
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,265
Were you watching me?

733
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:08,569
Scott, I've been
watching you for a while.

734
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:10,771
Ever since you
robbed Vista Corp.

735
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,274
Oh! Excuse me.

00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:15,876
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

737
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,746
Vista's security
system was one of

738
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,715
the most advanced
in the business.

739
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,517
It was supposed
to be unbeatable.

740
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,519
But you beat it.

741
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:26,920
Would you like some sugar?

742
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:28,522
Yeah, thanks.

743
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,661
You know what? I'm okay.

744
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,867
How do you make them do that?

745
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,770
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

746
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:47,474
They build, farm,
they cooperate
with each other.

747
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,476
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

748
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:56,817
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their
olfactory nerve center.

749
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,387
I speak to them.

750
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,623
I can go anywhere,
hear anything,

751
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,324
and see everything.

752
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,826
And still know
absolutely nothing.

You don't need to
raise your hand, Scott.

757
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:19,339
Sorry,
I just have one question.

00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,308
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

759
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,876
and can I go back to jail now?

760
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,911
Come with me.

761
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:27,014
40 years ago,
I created a formula

762
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,283
that altered atomic
relative distance.

763
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,751
SCOTT: Huh?

764
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:32,719
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

765
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:34,488
That's what powers the suit.

766
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,990
That's why it works.

767

00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:45,399
But it was dangerous.

771
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,968
It was too dangerous.

772
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,572
So I hid it from the world.

773
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,975
And that's when
I switched gears
and I started my own company.

00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,513
Yes.

776
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:03,383
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

777
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,518
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

778
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,986
He's a big deal.

779
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,588
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

780
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:12,826
I thought I saw
something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

781
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,395
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

782
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:18,865
he began to suspect
that I wasn't
telling him everything.

783
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:22,636
He heard rumors about
what was called
the Pym Particle,

784
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:26,340
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

785
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,342
But I wouldn't help him.

786
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,378
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out
of my own company.

787
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,979
How could he do that?

788
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:35,649
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

789
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:36,817
She was the deciding vote.

790
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,021
But she came back to me

791
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,857
when she saw how close
Cross was to
cracking my formula.

792
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,594
The process is
highly volatile.

00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:20,727
In the right hands,

883
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,697
the relationship
between man and suit
is symbiotic.

884
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,333
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

885
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:30,236
You need to be skillful,
agile,
and above all,

886
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,738
you need to be fast.

887
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,740
You should be able
to shrink and grow

888
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,341
on a dime.

889
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:38,445
So your size
always suits your needs.

890
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:41,848
Now dive through the keyhole,
Scott.

891
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:45,419
You charge big,
you dive small,
then you emerge big.

892
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,056
(THUDDING)

893
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,056
SCOTT: Ow!

894
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,958
(THUDDING)

895
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,958
Ahhh!

896
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,727
(THUDDING)

897
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,727
Ow!

898
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,461
Useless.

899
00:49:57,196 --> 00:49:58,498
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

900
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:00,900
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

901
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,070
behind a fist
a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

902
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:07,474
You punch too hard,
you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

903
00:50:07,507 --> 00:50:09,275
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

904
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:10,510
I was in prison
for three years.
I know how to punch.

905
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:12,512
Show me.

906
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,047
Terrible.

907
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,047
You wanna show
me how to punch?

908
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:15,882
Show me...

909
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:17,283
(GROANS)

910
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:19,319
That's how you punch.

911
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:20,754
She's been
looking forward to this.

912
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:22,222
No kidding.

913
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,891
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

914
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:27,026
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

915
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,162
We lost her in a plane crash.

916
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,964
It's bad enough
you won't tell
me how she died.

917
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:32,398
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

918
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:34,234
We're working, here.

919
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:38,972
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

920
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,109
Were you going for the hand?

921
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,817
You know,
I think this regulator
is holding me back.

922
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,386
Do not screw
with the regulator.

923
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:55,221
If that
regulator is compromised,

924
00:50:55,254 --> 00:50:57,023
you would go subatomic.

925
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:59,492
What does that mean?

926
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,561
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

927
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:03,263
What does that mean?

928
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:05,398
It means that you
would enter a reality

929
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:07,834
where all concepts
of time and space

930
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:08,968
become irrelevant

931
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,438
as you shrink
for all eternity.

932
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:15,008
Everything that you know

933
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:16,343
and love,

934
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:18,845
gone forever.

935
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:23,116
Cool.
Yeah, if it ain't broke...

936
00:51:23,149 --> 00:51:24,584
You've learned about the suit,

937
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:27,287
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

938
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,456
the ants.

939
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,591
Loyal, brave,

940
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:33,393
and your partners on this job.

941
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,602
HOPE:
Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

942
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,971
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

943
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,207
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

944
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,142
You're not so crazy.

945
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:50,310
(SQUEAKS)

946
00:51:50,343 --> 00:51:51,377
Hey!

(CHUCKLING) You're cute.

(SCREAMING)

949
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,890
That was a lot
scarier a second ago.

(GROANING)

953
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:16,603
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own
isolated power supply.

954
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:18,605
HOPE:  There's
a security guard posted
around the clock.

955
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:21,074
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate
the security systems.

956
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:23,443
SCOTT: Okay, who's next?

957
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:27,547
HOPE: Paraponera clavata.

958
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,015
SCOTT:  I know.
Bullet ants, right?

959
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,483
Number 1 on
the Schmidt pain index?

960
00:52:30,516 --> 00:52:32,319
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

961
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:35,288
(YELLS)

962
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,290
HOPE:  The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,

963
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,958
and the only
access point is a tube

964
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,527
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

965
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,463
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

966
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,932
HOPE:  The tube is protected
by a laser grid,

967
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,667
and we can only
power that down
for 15 seconds.

968
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,236
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to
blow the servers,

969
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:52,372
retrieve the suit,
and exit the vaults

970
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:54,407
before
the backup power comes on.

971
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,277
HOPE:
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

972
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,912
Alternatively known
as a carpenter ant.

973
00:52:58,945 --> 00:53:01,581
Ideal for ground
and air transport.

974
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:03,283
Wait a minute,
I know this guy.

975
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,120
I'm gonna call
him "Ant-thony."

976
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,454
That's good. That's very good.

977
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:10,657
Because this time,
you're really gonna

978
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,159
have to learn
how to control him.

979
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:16,062

Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

985
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:35,482
HANK:  The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.

986
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:37,450
Red shrinks.

987
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:40,220
Blue enlarges.

988
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,991

HANK:  Known for their bite,

990
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:49,662
the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.

They are handy to
get you in and out
of difficult places.

992

You can do it, Scott. Come on.

993
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:08,381
(HUFFS) They're
not listening to me.

You have to mean it.

(SIGHS) Throwing
insults into the mix

will not do
anyone any good, Hope.

time for coddling.

be on helping Scott!

Oh, God.

1008
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:21,421
You gotta lock your doors.

I mean, really,
there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

Do you think this is a joke?

1011

Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

1012
00:55:29,528 --> 00:55:30,797
You have a daughter.

1013
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,765
I'm doing this for her.

1014
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,201
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see
him for two weeks.

1015
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,303
He was in grief.

1016
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:38,838
Yeah,
so was I, and I was seven.

1017
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:42,175
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

1018
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,643
He just sent me off
to boarding school.

1019
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:46,179
You know, I thought,

1020
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:48,681
with all that's at stake,

1021
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:51,684
just maybe we
might have a chance
of making peace.

1022
00:55:51,717 --> 00:55:53,686
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

1023
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:56,622
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

1024
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,291
Then why are you here?

1025
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,126
It proves that he loves you.

Hope. Look at me.

1027
00:56:05,297 --> 00:56:06,733
I'm expendable.

1028
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,601
That's why I'm here.

1029
00:56:10,169 --> 00:56:12,839
You must have
realized that by now.

1030
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,707
I mean,
it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

1031
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,112
He would rather
lose this fight
than lose you.

Anyway...

1033
00:56:23,616 --> 00:56:26,619
You know,
I didn't know
you had a daughter

1034
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:28,655
when I called the cops on you.

1035
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:33,860
What's her name?

Cassie.

1037

It's a pretty name.

1038
00:56:42,535 --> 00:56:43,803
You have to clear
your mind, Scott.

1039
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,404
You have to make
your thoughts precise.

1040
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:47,207
That's how it works.

1041
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,209
Think about Cassie.

1042
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:53,746
About how badly
you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

1043
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:04,524
Open your eyes

1044
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:06,726
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

1045

That's good!

1046
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,637
Your mother convinced me

1047
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:55,408
to let her join
me on my missions.

1048
00:57:55,441 --> 00:57:57,476
They called her the Wasp.

1049
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:59,712
She was born to it.

1050
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,316
And there's not
a day that goes by

1051
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,220
that I don't
regret having said yes.

1052
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:14,327
It was 1987.

1053
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,631
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

1054
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:22,936
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

1055
00:58:30,776 --> 00:58:33,779
The only way to
the internal mechanics

1056
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:35,748
was through solid titanium.

1057
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:49,996
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to
disarm the missile.

1058
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:52,899
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

1059
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,469
Your mother,

1060
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:57,670
she didn't hesitate.

1061
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:01,441
Janet! No!

1062
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,683
She turned off her regulator

1063
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,952
and went subatomic

1064
00:59:14,653 --> 00:59:16,723
to deactivate the bomb.

1065
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,360
And she was gone.

1066
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,899
Your mom died a hero.

1067
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,004
And I spent the next 10 years

1068
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:36,342
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

1069
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:41,848
You were trying
to bring her back.

1070
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:47,287
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

1071
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,893
It's not your fault.

1072
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:57,930
She made her choice.

1073
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:07,373
(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you
tell me that sooner?

1074
01:00:07,406 --> 01:00:09,976
I was trying to protect you.

1075
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,613
I lost your mother.

1076
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:18,518
I didn't mean
to lose you, too.

1077
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:20,720
I'm sorry.

1078
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:25,358
This is awesome.

1079
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,561
It's awesome, you know?

1080
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:30,063
You guys are
breaking down walls,
you're healing.

1081
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:32,799
It's important.

1082
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:37,436
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1083
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:38,971
Yes, you did. Yes.

1084
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:41,874
I'm going to make some tea.

1085
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:48,781
Nailed it!

1086
01:00:58,056 --> 01:00:59,892
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1087
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,892
HANK:  The final
phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

1088
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,460
SCOTT: It's freezing!

1089
01:01:34,493 --> 01:01:37,496
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

1090
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,533
You must
retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

1091
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,135
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1092
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:44,904
HOPE: We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

1093
01:01:44,937 --> 01:01:46,606
that Cross installed
in the Futures vault.

1094
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:50,142
It's currently collecting dust

1095
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:52,878
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities
in upstate New York.

1096
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,914
Should be a piece of cake.

1097
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:56,882
You're over the target area.

1098
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:59,452
Disengage now, Scott!

1099
01:01:59,485 --> 01:02:00,486
Squadron A, go!

1100
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:01,821
B, go!

1101
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:06,459
C, go!

1102
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:09,829
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't
drop me this time.

1103
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:13,065
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

1104
01:02:13,098 --> 01:02:13,933
Stay calm.

1105
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:18,103
SCOTT: Guys?
We might have a problem.

1106
01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:21,607
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

1107
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,475
It's not!

1108
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,778
You son of a bitch!

1109
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:30,015
Scott, get out of there.

1110
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:30,015
Abort!

1111
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:31,750
Abort now!

1112
01:02:31,783 --> 01:02:33,986
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look
like anyone's home.

1113
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:36,055
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1114
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:38,090
He's gonna lose the suit.

1115
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,625
He's gonna lose his life.

1116
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:45,664
(GRUNTS)

1117
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:47,567
All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.

1118
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,102
Somebody's home, Scott.

1119
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,807
MAN:
What's going on
down there, Sam?

1120
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,809
SCOTT: It's the Falcon!

1121
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:58,744
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

1122
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:00,579
Wait a second.

1123
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,648
HANK: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1124
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:04,049
It's okay. He can't see me.

1125
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:05,184
I can see you.

1126
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:06,152
He can see me.

1127
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,890
Hi. I'm Scott.

1128
01:03:10,923 --> 01:03:12,591
Did he just say,
"Hi, I'm Scott"?

1129
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:14,126
What are you doing here?

1130
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,995
First off, I'm a big fan.

1131
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:17,230
Appreciate it.
So, who the hell are you?

1132
01:03:18,263 --> 01:03:19,298
I'm Ant-Man.

1133
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:20,833
"Ant-Man"?

1134
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,002
What? You haven't heard of me?

1135
01:03:23,035 --> 01:03:25,170
No, you wouldn't
have heard of me.

1136
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:26,906
You wanna tell
me what you want?

1137
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:29,208
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1138
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:31,210
Just for a few days.
I'm gonna return it.

1139
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:33,913
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1140
01:03:33,946 --> 01:03:35,181
I know exactly how that is.

1141
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:37,249
Located the breach.

1142
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:38,184
Bringing him in.

1143
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:38,184
Sorry about this!

1144
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,690
What the hell are you doing?

1145
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:49,161
FALCON:
Breach is an adult male,

1146
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:50,062
who has some sort
of shrinking tech.

1147
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:04,977
SCOTT: Sorry!

1148
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,112
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Sorry.

1149
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,080
That's enough!

1150
01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:31,103
(GROANING)

1151
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:32,805
Ant-thony! A little help!

1152
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:46,352
I've lost visual.

1154
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:57,129
He's inside my pack!

1155
01:04:57,162 --> 01:04:58,197
Sorry!

1156
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:00,800
You seem like
a really great guy.

1157
01:05:10,442 --> 01:05:12,178
(GRUNTING)

1158
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:29,962
It's really important to me
that Cap never
finds out about this.

1159
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:36,736
That was
completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1160
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,672
You jeopardized everything!

1161
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:57,223
You got it.

1162
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:01,260
Well done.

1163
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:02,327
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

1164
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,829
Did you just compliment me?

1165
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:05,097
He did, didn't he?

1166
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,965
Kind of sounded like he did.

(BEEPING SOFTLY)

1168
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:09,768

(SCOFFS)

1170
01:06:11,803 --> 01:06:15,074
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought
an Avenger and didn't die?

1171
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:17,443
Let us not dwell on the past.

1172
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,378
We gotta finish our planning.

1173
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,416
HOPE: Don't mind him.

1174
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,184
You did good.

1175
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,292
Darren.

1176
01:06:36,294 --> 01:06:37,963
How the hell did
you get in here?

1177
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:41,800
You left
the front door open, Hank.

1178
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,868
It's official.

1179
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,003
You're old.

1180
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:45,771
The plans.

1181
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:48,774
He will kill him.

1182
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,480
Well, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

1183
01:06:55,914 --> 01:06:57,249
I have good news.

1184
01:06:57,282 --> 01:06:58,350
Really?

1185
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,120
What's that?

1186
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:05,824
Pym Tech,
the company you created,

1187
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:07,826
is about to
become one of the most

1188

We're anticipating
$15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

You're welcome.

1191
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:28,547
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1192
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,349
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1193
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:33,418
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1194
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,754
I'll be there.

1195
01:07:52,003 --> 01:07:53,239
What did you see in me?

1196
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:56,942
I don't know what you mean.

1197
01:07:56,975 --> 01:07:59,378
All those years ago,
you picked me.

I saw myself.

Then why did you push me away?

1201
01:08:09,421 --> 01:08:12,792
Because I saw
too much of myself.

HOPE:  He knows.
He's baiting you.

1203
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:27,072
We have to call it off.

1204
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:28,140
We're all taking risks.

1205

I just saw Hank.

1213

I still get nothing
but contempt from him.

1214
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:54,433
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1215
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:57,002
We need to start
everyone working
around the clock.

1216
01:08:57,035 --> 01:08:58,904
Get the assembly
line up and running.

1217
01:08:58,937 --> 01:09:00,239
And I'm tripling security.

1218
01:09:00,272 --> 01:09:02,341
Full sensors at all entrances

1219
01:09:02,374 --> 01:09:05,644
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1220
01:09:05,677 --> 01:09:08,280
Great. Good idea.

1221
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:11,483
Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to
have you on my team.

1222
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,657
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind,
and he's onto you.

1223
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,893
But he is not onto you.

1224
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:23,128
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1225
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:25,163
and closing exterior vents.

1226
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:26,932
How are we gonna
get Scott inside?

1227
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:29,969
The water main.

1228
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:33,238
You can't add
security to a water main.

1229
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:35,440
The pressure is too strong,

01:44:30,033 --> 01:44:32,268
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1760
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:33,537
Really, Hope.

1761
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,506
Scott.

1762
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,506
Yeah?

1763
01:44:36,539 --> 01:44:38,308
You're full of shit.

1764
01:44:36,539 --> 01:44:38,308
Oh, yeah.

1765
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:42,078
PAXTON: Scott,
I met with my captain today.

1766
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:45,215
He wanted
a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1767
01:44:45,248 --> 01:44:46,350
Something happened
with the cameras.

1768
01:44:47,216 --> 01:44:49,386
Some circuits got fried.

1769
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:53,023
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1770
01:44:53,056 --> 01:44:54,224
Really?

1771
01:44:54,257 --> 01:44:55,459
PAXTON: Well, yeah.

1772
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,230
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on
a technical glitch, right?

1773
01:45:00,263 --> 01:45:02,298
Thank you, Paxton.

1774
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:04,734
I'm blown away.

1775
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:06,403
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1776
01:45:06,436 --> 01:45:08,472
Well, that's my pleasure.

1777
01:45:09,705 --> 01:45:12,642
But, no.
This one, I did for you.

1778
01:45:15,078 --> 01:45:16,346
This is awkward.

1779
01:45:15,078 --> 01:45:16,346
Yeah.

1780
01:45:16,379 --> 01:45:18,415
Yeah.

1781
01:45:16,379 --> 01:45:18,415
(LAUGHING)

1782
01:45:18,448 --> 01:45:19,749
I mean,
what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1783
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:21,418
Oh, I know.

1784
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:21,418
What?

1785
01:45:21,451 --> 01:45:22,585
I did my first
cartwheel today.

1786
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:24,054
What?

1787
01:45:24,087 --> 01:45:26,523
Yeah. She has been
practicing all week.

1788
01:45:26,556 --> 01:45:28,224
But today was the magic day.

1789
01:45:28,257 --> 01:45:29,059
I recorded it on my phone.
Here.

1790
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,363
SCOTT:
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1791
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:35,331
MAGGIE: Yeah, it is.

1792
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:35,331
CASSIE: Yeah, it is.

1793
01:45:35,364 --> 01:45:37,233
SCOTT: This is
a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1794
01:45:37,266 --> 01:45:38,201
PAXTON: Yeah, that's her.

1795
01:45:39,135 --> 01:45:40,537
Good boy.

1796
01:45:42,638 --> 01:45:45,408
Sweetie, that's
pretty amazing, peanut.

1797
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:46,810
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

1798
01:45:48,311 --> 01:45:49,312
Sorry.

1799
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,716
It's work.

1800
01:45:53,382 --> 01:45:54,618
Yeah.

1801
01:45:56,352 --> 01:45:57,587
All right.

1802
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,422
Here's the deal.
Just give me the facts.

1803
01:45:59,455 --> 01:46:00,590
Just the facts.
Only the facts.

1804
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:04,761
Breathe.
Focus. Keep it simple.

1805
01:46:04,794 --> 01:46:06,563
No, no, no.
No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1806
01:46:06,596 --> 01:46:09,265
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1807
01:46:09,298 --> 01:46:12,102
And there was this, like,
abstract
expressionism exhibit.

1808
01:46:12,135 --> 01:46:14,737
But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist
kind of guy, right?

1809
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:16,139
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro!
Oh, my God!

1810
01:46:16,172 --> 01:46:17,307
Luis.

1811
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,575
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1812
01:46:18,608 --> 01:46:20,443
You know,
I just get excited and stuff.

1813
01:46:20,476 --> 01:46:22,679
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1814
01:46:22,712 --> 01:46:24,581
"Yo, I met this
crazy-fine writer chick

1815
01:46:24,614 --> 01:46:26,382
"at the Spot last night.
Like fine-fine.

1816
01:46:26,415 --> 01:46:27,851
"Like crazy-stupid fine."
And he

1817
01:46:27,884 --> 01:46:30,220
"goes up to
the bartender and goes,

1818
01:46:30,253 --> 01:46:31,821
"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1819
01:46:31,854 --> 01:46:34,157
"She's
crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1820
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,792
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1821
01:46:35,825 --> 01:46:38,528
So this writer
chick tells Ignacio,

1822
01:46:38,561 --> 01:46:40,763
"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of
guerrilla journalism,

1823
01:46:40,796 --> 01:46:42,198
"and I got mad connects
with the peeps
behind the curtains,

1824
01:46:42,231 --> 01:46:43,433
"you know what I'm saying?"

1825
01:46:43,466 --> 01:46:45,335
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1826
01:46:45,368 --> 01:46:47,170
And she's like,
"Yeah, you know what,

1827
01:46:47,203 --> 01:46:48,872
I can't tell you
who my contact is,

1828
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:49,539
"because he works
with the Avengers."

1829
01:46:49,572 --> 01:46:51,141
Oh, no.

1830
01:46:51,174 --> 01:46:52,375
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1831
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:54,344
Like,
he comes up to her and says,

1832
01:46:54,377 --> 01:46:55,745
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1833
01:46:55,778 --> 01:46:57,847
"who's flashing
his fresh tack,

1834
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,582
"who's got,
like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1835
01:46:59,615 --> 01:47:01,217
And she's like,
"Well, we got everything

1836
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,820
nowadays.
We got a guy who jumps.

1837
01:47:03,853 --> 01:47:05,288
"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who
crawls up the walls.

1838
01:47:05,321 --> 01:47:07,690
"You gotta be more specific."

1839
01:47:07,723 --> 01:47:09,192
And he's like,
"I'm looking for
a guy that shrinks."

1840
01:47:09,225 --> 01:47:10,493
And I'm, like, "Damn!"
I got all nervous

1841
01:47:10,526 --> 01:47:12,162
'cause I'd keep mad
secrets for you, bro.

1842
01:47:12,195 --> 01:47:14,230
So I asked Ignacio,

1843
01:47:14,263 --> 01:47:15,832
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1844
01:47:15,865 --> 01:47:17,534
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm
tight with Ant-Man,

1845
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:18,768
"that he's looking for him?"

1846
01:47:19,435 --> 01:47:21,805
And? What'd he say?

1847
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,710
He said, "Yes."

1848
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,893
There's something
I want to show you.

1849
01:49:26,495 --> 01:49:29,532
I realized you
can't destroy power.

1850
01:49:31,467 --> 01:49:34,971
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1851
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:44,080
This is an advanced prototype

1852
01:49:44,113 --> 01:49:46,783
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1853
01:49:48,551 --> 01:49:51,888
She never got to use it.

1854
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:55,892
But now I
realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1855
01:50:02,932 --> 01:50:05,068
Maybe it's time
we finished it.

1856
01:50:11,907 --> 01:50:14,344
It's about damn time.

1857
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:16,039
FALCON:  Hey, Cap!

1858
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:33,022
This would have
been a lot easier
a week ago.

1859
01:56:33,055 --> 01:56:34,824
If we call Tony...

1860
01:56:33,055 --> 01:56:34,824
He won't believe us.

1861
01:56:34,857 --> 01:56:36,192
Even if he did...

1862
01:56:36,225 --> 01:56:37,427
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1863
01:56:39,161 --> 01:56:40,730
We're on our own.

1864
01:56:42,097 --> 01:56:43,232
Maybe not.

1865
01:56:45,934 --> 01:56:47,070
I know a guy.
